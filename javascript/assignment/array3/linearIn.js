/*Given two arrays of ints sorted in increasing order, outer and inner, return true if all of the numbers in inner appear in outer. The best solution makes only a single "linear" pass of both arrays, taking advantage of the fact that both arrays are already in sorted order.

Examples

linearIn([1, 2, 4, 6], [2, 4]) → true
linearIn([1, 2, 4, 6], [2, 3, 4]) → false
linearIn([1, 2, 4, 4, 6], [2, 4]) → true*/
function linearIn(outer, inner){
let j = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < outer.length; i++) {
    if (inner[j] == outer[i]) {
      j++;
    }
  }

  return j == inner.length;
  
}
